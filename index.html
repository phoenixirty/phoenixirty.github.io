<p style="text-align: center;">Notes before checking this "catalogue" out :</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: center;"><em>Every file made by me is for sure CC BY 4.0</em></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><em>Be sure to go to your chosen file to copy the correct attributions</em></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><em>Each video/picture you see has a thumbnail and that thumbnail has been scaled down to 360p to speed up loading times hence why I'm using full HTML, So the video/picture resolution is in fact not the same and the real resolution should be in its downloads name OR maybe the title.</em></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><em>All of the file downloads are hosted personally even if they aren't under my username (If I made them otherwise I will definitely point you to the appropriate download :D)</em></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><em>All of these files are handpicked and usable with attribution, if you don't want to attribute me email me at a mail I will be putting up soon and you can use it without attributing me (i want to get your email so I can see what you're working on, tho if you don't wanna bother and just use it without attributing me OR without sending an email I don't think you have morals and if so go for it (Before I put up an email you can freely use them without attributing :D ) ).</em></li>
<li style="text-align: center;"><em>You are a legend &hearts;</em></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thank you if you read it and if you didn't it was mostly some disclaimers and terms for using without attribution so not much, ENJOY!</p>
